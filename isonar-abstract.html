                    This research presents the development of ISONAR (IoT System for
Organic and Non-Organic Waste Sorter). This product was developed
based on IoT and some concerns about flooding due to piles of garbage
that people throw into rivers. ISONAR (IoT System for Organic and
Non-Organic Waste Sorter) presents several features that are very helpful
in activities regarding the collection and sorting of waste in both organic
and non-organic forms. ISONAR (IoT System for Organic and
Non-Organic Waste Sorter) uses several important components such as
ESP8266 as a liaison between users and Ultrasonic distance sensors as a
waste detector that follows the river current. To avoid the wrong entry of
waste into other waste containers, there is a tool in the form of a Water
Pump that helps create an artificial current so that waste does not enter
the wrong place and cause an imbalance between organic and
non-organic containers. ISONAR (IoT System for Organic and
Non-Organic Waste Sorter) brings multiple benefits, including reducing
manual labour, saving energy, and minimising river waste. ISONAR (IoT
System for Organic and Non-Organic Waste Sorter) was also created with
the hope that the product is compact, user-friendly, and can work in all
weather. And with the creation of this product can open the eyes of the
community especially the younger generations as the successors of the
nation to be more concerned with the environment and open their eyes
that technology is not limited to things that smell of work, traffic and
gadgets in each person's life. Future developments allow for better
sensors and neater and more concise cable arrangements.
